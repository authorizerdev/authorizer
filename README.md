# Getting Started

## Trying out Authorizer

This guide helps you practice using Authorizer to evaluate it before you use it in a production environment. It includes instructions for installing the Authorizer server in standalone mode.

## Installing a simple instance of Authorizer

Deploy Authorizer using [heroku](https://github.com/authorizerdev/authorizer-heroku) and quickly play with it in 30seconds
<br/><br/>
[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/authorizerdev/authorizer-heroku)

### Things to consider

- For social logins, you will need respective social platform key and secret
- For having verified users, you will need an SMTP server with an email address and password using which system can send emails. The system will send a verification link to an email address. Once an email is verified then, only able to access it.
  > Note: One can always disable the email verification to allow open sign up, which is not recommended for production as anyone can use anyone's email address üòÖ
- For persisting user sessions, you will need Redis URL. If you do not configure a Redis server, sessions will be persisted until the instance is up or not restarted. For better response time on authorization requests/middleware, we recommend deploying Redis on the same infra/network as your authorizer server.

## Integrating into your website

This example demonstrates how you can use [`@authorizerdev/authorizer-js`](/authorizer-js/getting-started) CDN version and have login ready for your site in few seconds. You can also use the ES module version of [`@authorizerdev/authorizer-js`](/authorizer-js/getting-started) or framework-specific versions like [`@authorizerdev/authorizer-react`](/authorizer-react/getting-started)

### Copy the following code in `html` file

> **Note:** Change AUTHORIZER_URL in the below code with your authorizer URL. Also, you can change the logout button component

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@authorizerdev/authorizer-js/lib/authorizer.min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  const authorizerRef = new authorizerdev.Authorizer({
    authorizerURL: `AUTHORIZER_URL`,
    redirectURL: window.location.origin,
  });

  // use the button selector as per your application
  const logoutBtn = document.getElementById("logout");
  logoutBtn.addEventListener("click", async function () {
    await authorizerRef.logout();
    window.location.href = "/";
  });

  async function onLoad() {
    const res = await authorizerRef.fingertipLogin();
    if (res && res.user) {
      // you can use user information here, eg:
      /**
      const userSection = document.getElementById('user');
      const logoutSection = document.getElementById('logout-section');
      logoutSection.classList.toggle('hide');
      userSection.innerHTML = `Welcome, ${res.user.email}`;
      */
    }
  }
  onLoad();
</script>
```
